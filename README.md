      About Us
      We are the team 'Nivala' and we stand for making this world a better place. We aim to fight against the common problem faced by this world, Hunger. We want to save and share food. It's a place where we want to bring in the people who wants to share food and would want to give away food to the people in need.

      OUR HISTORY
      In 2018 November, Prajwal Waingankar(myself), a student who wanted to solve this global problem using his technological knowledge             founded 'Nivala'.

      He decided to make an app where people with excess food can share it with just a click, and it should be delivered to the ones who need it.
